# AI-agent

## Overview

AI-agent is a multi-language, modular project designed for developing, testing, and benchmarking AI agents. The repository provides foundational and advanced agent implementations in Python, with a structure that supports future expansion to JavaScript, C, and C++. The project is organized for easy experimentation, extension, and integration with other AI tools.

## Features
- **Multi-language support:** Core implementations in Python, with a structure ready for JavaScript, C, and C++ agents.
- **Modular design:** Each agent is self-contained, with clear separation between simple and advanced agents.
- **Extensible architecture:** Easily add new agents, workflows, or models.
- **Ready for research and prototyping:** Ideal for rapid prototyping, benchmarking, and educational purposes.

## Project Structure

- `advanced-agent/` – Advanced AI agent implementation in Python.
  - `main.py` – Entry point for the advanced agent.
  - `src/` – Source code for advanced agent logic, including:
    - `firecrawl.py`, `models.py`, `prompts.py`, `workflow.py`
  - `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` – Python project configuration and dependencies.
- `advanced-ai-agent/` – Alternative advanced agent implementation with similar structure.
- `simple-agent/` – Simple AI agent implementation in Python.
  - `main.py` – Entry point for the simple agent.
- `simple-ai-agent/` – Alternative simple agent implementation.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agent.git
   cd ai-agent
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   Each agent has its own dependencies. For Python agents:
   ```bash
   cd advanced-agent
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or use pyproject.toml with poetry/uv
   ```
   Repeat for other agent directories as needed.
3. **Run an agent:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
